# Lintalist bundles

To install a bundle, simply download the file below and place it in the **bundles\**
folder which you can find in your __lintalist__ folder. You need to restart Lintalist
in order for the new bundle(s) to load.

Be sure to check the __TitleMatch:__ label in the bundle, you may need to alter it to
suit your needs. You can either do this by directly editing the file in your editor or
by loading and selecting the bundle and use the built-in bundle editor, see http://lintalist.github.io/#Editing
